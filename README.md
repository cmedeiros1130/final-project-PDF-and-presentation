## CS 250 Module Eight Journal â€“ Reflection

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**  
I take project requirements and break them into user stories with clear goals. These stories help define what the user wants, and they guide the development of features that meet those needs.

**2. How do I approach developing programs, and what Agile processes will I use in the future?**  
I approach development using Agile practices such as planning in sprints, writing user stories, holding stand-ups, and performing retrospectives. I plan to continue using these processes in future projects because they help maintain focus, adapt to change, and improve collaboration.

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, supporting teammates, completing tasks on time, and staying accountable. Participating in reviews and retrospectives and giving feedback also strengthens the team and the product.
